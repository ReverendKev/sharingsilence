    On <strong>June 18th</strong>, from Perth and the ACT, someone inside the system opened this site …and took the files.

<h2>📄 Official Record of Delays — Documented Responses</h2>

<h3>📬 CEO Response: Delayed Acknowledgment</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We will be unable to meet your timeline of today. We will endeavour to provide a response by the end of next week.”<br>
  — Debra Zanella, CEO, Ruah Community Services</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Received:</strong> 6 June 2025</p>
<p><em>Context:</em> This message was received 7 days after formal notification was sent (30 May 2025). No immediate response, no resolution — only a postponed deadline.</p>
<hr>
<h3>📑 Complaints Procedure Timeline</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Please note that this process may take up to 15 working days.”<br>
  — Elsie Blay, Executive Manager, Services</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Received:</strong> 30 May 2025 (now 14th June 2025, timeframe is now elapsed)</p>
<p><em>Context:</em> Ruah initiated a slow internal review process while risks remained unaddressed. They allocated themselves three full weeks to respond — despite the urgency already outlined.</p>
<hr>
<h3>🔒 Legal Firm Closure Notice</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We will not be engaging any further with you in respect of these issues.”<br>
  — Shannon Mony, Meridian Lawyers (acting for Ruah)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Received:</strong> 13 June 2025</p>
<p><em>Context:</em> This was issued just 7 days after the CEO promised a response — abruptly ending communication without follow-up.</p>

<h2>System Impact Report — Ongoing Harm</h2>

<p><em>This system failure is actively harming me.</em></p>

<p>I am now trapped in an autistic hyperfixation loop that I cannot break until a resolution is reached.</p>

<p>I cannot eat properly.<br>
I cannot sleep properly.<br>
Basic hygiene is failing.<br>
I have run out of essential medication and do not feel safe enough to leave my house to get more.</p>

<p>No support services are available — they are all implicated in the systemic failure.</p>

<p>I am being left to collapse mentally and physically while this corporate system stalls and watches.</p>

<p>This is no longer about the past.<br>
This is about what is being done to me <strong>right now</strong> — today.</p>

<p><em>The archive remains live. The system is not still.</em></p>

  <p><em>(Sent to Ruah — Final Outreach, 29th May 2025)</em></p>


  <p>I don’t know who’s reading this.<br>
  Maybe we’ve never met.<br>
  Maybe you’re staff.<br>
  Maybe you’re admin, management — or just someone who got CC’d.</p>

  <p>You didn’t ask for this.<br>
  But now you have it.<br>
  And I need you to hear me.</p>

  <p>I’m autistic.<br>
  My mind is sharp — until I’m overwhelmed.<br>
  Then everything collapses.<br>
  I go non-verbal.<br>
  My speech shuts down.<br>
  My body freezes.<br>
  People think I don’t understand.<br>
  But I do.<br>
  I just can’t get the words out when I need them most.<br>
  And I remember everything.</p>

  <hr>

<p style="color: #B7D1B0; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Ten years ago, Ruah assigned me a support worker. Her name was Mary.</p>



  <p>She stabilised my life.<br>
  I started therapy.<br>
  I got my children back.<br>
  Supervised visits became overnights.<br>
  My world was coming back together.</p>

  <p>Then — Mary left.<br>
  No warning. No transition. No handover.<br>
  Just gone.</p>

  <p>And everything fell apart.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>The NDIS changed.<br>
  My funding stayed — but my supports vanished.<br>
  A provider entered my home. They touched my things. They left.<br>
  The money disappeared.</p>

  <p>I reported it. Nothing happened.<br>
  Another provider came.<br>
  They never returned. I still don’t know why.<br>
  Calls followed. Cold. Pressuring. Overwhelming.<br>
  There was no continuity. No care.<br>
  I didn’t know who these people were.<br>
  I still don’t.</p>

  <p>My GP left.<br>
  I relapsed. First on opioids. Then on alcohol.<br>
  My mother became terminal. I became her carer.<br>
  Then she died.</p>

  <p>If anyone from Ruah reached out — I don’t remember.<br>
  If they did, it didn’t hold.</p>

  <p>Because what I needed was someone who wouldn’t vanish when I couldn’t speak.<br>
  Someone who understood what <strong>real crisis</strong> looks like.<br>
  And in that darkness — I lost my children again.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Not by court.<br>
  Not by choice.<br>
  But by silence.</p>

  <p>Ten years ago, we had a court-ordered agreement.<br>
  I followed it. Every step. Every condition.<br>
  My children were back in my life.</p>

  <p>Then I lost my support.<br>
  Then my ex moved. Cut contact.<br>
  And I didn’t have the strength, the knowledge, or the backing to fight it.</p>

  <p>I didn’t disappear.<br>
  I was erased.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Now they grow up believing I walked away.<br>
  That I gave up.<br>
  That I didn’t care.</p>

  <p>But I didn’t.<br>
  I was alone.<br>
  And no system — not one — stepped in to pull me back.</p>

  <p>I missed birthdays.<br>
  I missed years.<br>
  And I will never get that time back.<br>
  And neither will they.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>You say you protect the vulnerable.<br>
  But when I became one again — you weren’t there.</p>

  <p>You had the records.<br>
  The notes.<br>
  The risk flags.<br>
  You saw it.<br>
  You knew.</p>

  <p>And you did nothing.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>I’m not writing this to shame you.<br>
  I’m writing this because <strong>you need to understand what silence costs.</strong></p>

  <p>And now, if you’ve read this far — <strong>you’re holding it too.</strong></p>

  <p>Because this letter didn’t land in one inbox.<br>
  It’s being read.<br>
  Right now.<br>
  In offices. In meetings.<br>
  Between emails. Between shifts.<br>
  Quietly. Carefully.</p>

  <p>Someone is already rereading it.<br>
  Someone is already wondering what this means.<br>
  Maybe even asking questions.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what this letter will do.<br>
  Maybe nothing.<br>
  Maybe something.</p>

  <p>But whatever happens next — <strong>even if it’s silence again — it will say something.</strong></p>

  <p>About you.<br>
  About this system.<br>
  About all of us.</p>

  <hr>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">I’m Kev.<br>
  I’ve carried this alone for too long.<br>
  And I don’t know what’s left of me.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaaaaa; margin-top: 1.5em;"><em><strong>Please.</strong></em></p>

<h3>Recent Escalations — Intimidation and Unsafe Environment</h3>

<p><blockquote>"Scheduling will be in touch to schedule a time for a home visit. Two staff will be in attendance. I will bring the relevant documents for your signature."</p>

<p>- Sheila J. — initial Ruah contact, after several meltdowns had already occurred. This message led to feeling intensely intimidated — as if my home was about to be invaded and I would be forced to sign legal documents under duress.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Meet at the café for this appointment. We can then discuss the location of any potential future appointments after the initial assessment."</p>
  <p>
    — Rachael (Ruah Scheduling), following Sheila’s handover.  
    This clearly indicates that first appointments are ordinarily conducted in neutral public settings — not via unrequested home visits.  
    The contrast highlights that Sheila’s insistence on an initial home attendance was abnormal and, in this context, deeply intimidating.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For weeks now, I have been left feeling unsafe in my own home.</p>

<p>Since that point, the following has occurred:</p>

<ul>
<li>Police have been called to my home to try to remove me.</li>
<li>An Alma St crisis team has been called to try to remove me from my home.</li>
<li>Multiple calls from Alma St trying to pressure me into hospital admission.</li>
<li>Numerous phone calls from housing connected to this case.</li>
<li>Unexpected knocks from 'official' looking individuals at my door — at unpredictable times — causing acute distress.</li>
</ul>

<p>I no longer feel safe to leave my home — or even to answer my door.</p>

<p>I do not know who is contacting these parties — but it is not me.</p>

<p>My home is my only safe space — and I am now being left to feel that it is under threat of invasion and coercion.</p>

<p>This is an unacceptable escalation — and is compounding the direct harm already being caused.</p>

  Preview: Born Wrong In Their World (Memoir Excerpt)
</h4>

<p>I was born in the ’80s.</p>

<p>It was a different world back then. No internet. No awareness. People didn’t speak of things they didn’t understand — they hid them. Buried them. Erased them with shame.</p>

<p>I must’ve been around three. I don’t have clear memories from then — which tells me I was still very young.<br>
But I remember fear. That part never left.<br>
Not fear of anything in particular — just an ambient, silent dread.</p>

<p>There are photos of me smiling.<br>
So I know, logically, that I must’ve laughed. Played. Been held.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Preschool: Echoes of a Beginning</h3>

<p>I have faint memories of preschool.<br>
Faint — but persistent.<br>
Fragments, like old film reels burned at the edges.</p>

<p>There was a girl.<br>
Sarah? Sara? Something like that.<br>
Smaller than me. Long, straight light-brown hair.<br>
I don’t remember her face — just a blur framed by hair and movement.</p>

<p>What I do remember is the feeling.<br>
Uncomfortable, unfamiliar — but not bad.<br>
Something like belonging, though I didn’t understand it then.</p>

<p>Every time we walked through the preschool gates, she’d appear — out of nowhere.<br>
Run up, jump, stretch, kiss me on the cheek, and vanish again.<br>
Routine. Predictable. Like clockwork.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a one-off.<br>
Mum mentioned it once, offhand, like it amused her.<br>
So it must’ve happened often enough to etch itself into her memory too.</p>

<p>But to me?<br>
It’s just Sarah — or Sara — a soft glitch in the beginning of a system that never made sense.<br>
Not a love story. Not even a friendship.<br>
Just a ghost loop from a time I didn’t understand myself yet.</p>

<p>Autism flattens some things like that.<br>
She’s not a person in my head — she’s a pattern.<br>
And like most things from back then, she fades before I can ask her name.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are other fragments from preschool — some confirmed by Mum, some lost to the fog.<br>
One sticks hard.</p>

<p>It was early on.<br>
Recess? Lunch? Whatever they called it.<br>
All the kids would run out to play — to the sandpits, the swings, the chaos of childhood freedom.</p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p>I froze.<br>
Right where Mum left me.<br>
Inside.</p>

<p>Not out of defiance. Not out of confusion.<br>
But because my body wouldn’t move.<br>
Not couldn’t. Wouldn’t.</p>

<p>My mind screamed: <em>Move.</em><br>
My body replied: <em>Nope.</em><br>
Mind: <em>MOVE!</em><br>
Body: <em>hehehehe… watch this.</em></p>

<p>And then I pissed myself.<br>
Not because I wasn’t toilet trained. I was.<br>
But because the shutdown was total.</p>

<p>Tears. Heat. The teacher’s voice — too loud, too close.<br>
Dragged out in front of everyone. A scene. A freak.</p>

<p>It didn’t happen just once.<br>
It happened enough times that someone eventually caught on:<br>
If a shadow walked with me, I could move.<br>
I just needed to feel safe.</p>

<p>“Do you know how to use the toilet, Kevin?”<br>
Nod.<br>
“Are you sure?”<br>
Nod.<br>
“Kevin?”<br>
Face screws up. Meltdown begins.</p>

<p>Because repeating myself isn’t easy.<br>
Because being asked the same question over and over triggers panic — not understanding.<br>
Because autism doesn’t always mean “different.”<br>
Sometimes it means <em>done explaining.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Where that memory fades, I don’t know.<br>
Time has never been linear for me.</p>

<p>It loops.<br>
It collapses in on itself.<br>
My brain doesn’t sort life by date — it sorts it by pattern.</p>

<p>And sometimes…<br>
I see things before they happen.<br>
Not magic. Not prophecy.<br>
Just pattern recognition at a level most people never trained for.</p>

<p>But that’s a story for later — deeper in the saga.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.</p>

<hr>

<p>But I don’t remember it.<br>
And that absence has haunted me more than any violent memory ever could.</p>

<p>Did that part of me die?<br>
Or is it still there — buried beneath years of noise and survival?</p>

<p>I didn’t socialise. I didn’t speak the “right” way.<br>
I didn’t fit.</p>

<p>So they took me to a doctor.<br>
Who? When? I don’t know.<br>
They never told me.<br>
They never tell kids like me.</p>

<p>Even now, the records are lost. Or hidden. Or locked away somewhere.<br>
And somehow, it’s always my fault.</p>

<p>The word came back: Asperger’s.<br>
But instead of answers, it brought denial.</p>

<p>“No. Our child is not retarded.”</p>

<p>That was the end of it.<br>
The diagnosis vanished.<br>
No support. No accommodation. No acknowledgement.<br>
It would not be spoken of again — not until decades later, when a dying woman muttered truths between her regrets.</p>

<p>She lost every child she ever bore.<br>
And yet, I stayed.</p>

<p>Why?<br>
Because no one deserves to die alone. Not even her.<br>
I didn’t stay out of guilt.<br>
I stayed because it was right.<br>
And doing what’s right is how I live with myself.</p>

<hr>

<p>“My son will not be a retard.”<br>
“Don’t be a pussy boy.”<br>
“Men don’t cry.”<br>
“I’ll beat the man into you.”</p>

<p>That was my father.<br>
A man who clung to the memory of a short stint in the army reserves like it made him something.</p>

<p>Our house was a training ground.<br>
Discipline. Routine. Domination.</p>

<p>I was a child.<br>
He treated me like a soldier.</p>

<p>And I didn’t understand why I couldn’t keep up.<br>
Why I kept breaking the rules I didn’t know existed.<br>
Why everything I did — how I moved, felt, flinched, froze — was wrong.</p>

<p>I wasn’t broken.<br>
The world was.<br>
And I was being punished for not conforming to a world that refused to make space for difference.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’ve never asked to be treated differently.<br>
I’ve only ever asked for the world to change —<br>
because <em>we are different.</em></p>

<p>And that difference matters.</p>

<section class="memoir-entry">
  <h2>Early Memory Fragment – “Behind the Chair”</h2>

  <p>The memories are scattered — some vague, others sharp in feeling but blurred in detail.<br>
  They were likely buried, either by trauma or by survival instinct. I don’t know.</p>

  <p>But I know the pain. And I know the confusion.</p>

  <p>My sister was three years older than me.<br>
  She was also harmed — I believe by our father. Whether she was told to act the way she did, or whether it was trauma acting through her, I can’t know.<br>
  She cut contact with the family years ago, blamed <em>me</em>, and vanished. I never understood why. Still don’t.</p>

  <p>One of my earliest memories is of an armchair in her bedroom.<br>
  I was hiding behind it — not from danger exactly, just… hiding.<br>
  She was there too. And she told me to do things.<br>
  I didn’t understand them. I was three. She was six.<br>
  I didn’t know what “right” or “wrong” was. Just that something felt off.</p>

  <p>I remember another setting — under the blankets.<br>
  Things happened there too. Things that happened more than once.<br>
  She gave me instructions I didn’t understand — not then, not fully even now.<br>
  She used words I didn’t know, told me to act out things I didn’t yet have a body for.</p>

  <p>I don’t know how long it went on.<br>
  I don’t know how often.<br>
  But I remember the pattern.<br>
  That’s how my brain holds things — not in sequence, but in repetition.</p>

  <p>This is what my earliest years looked like.<br>
  Not joy. Not laughter. Just confusion, pressure, obedience, and a sense of something being deeply wrong.</p>

  <p>I don’t have good memories until maybe age 10 or 11 — and even those are tangled in later pain.<br>
  But they exist, small as they are.<br>
  And I hold onto those few flecks of light — because on the dark days, they’re all I’ve got.</p>
