<h2>System Impact Report ‚Äî Ongoing Harm</h2>

<p><em>This system failure is actively harming me.</em></p>

<p>I am now trapped in an autistic hyperfixation loop that I cannot break until a resolution is reached.</p>

<p>I cannot eat properly.<br>
I cannot sleep properly.<br>
Basic hygiene is failing.<br>
I have run out of essential medication and do not feel safe enough to leave my house to get more.</p>

<p>No support services are available ‚Äî they are all implicated in the systemic failure.</p>

<p>I am being left to collapse mentally and physically while this corporate system stalls and watches.</p>

<p>This is no longer about the past.<br>
This is about what is being done to me <strong>right now</strong> ‚Äî today.</p>

<p><em>The archive remains live. The system is not still.</em></p>

<h3>Recent Escalations ‚Äî Intimidation and Unsafe Environment</h3>

<p><blockquote>"Scheduling will be in touch to schedule a time for a home visit. Two staff will be in attendance. I will bring the relevant documents for your signature."</p>

<p>- Sheila J. ‚Äî initial Ruah contact, after several meltdowns had already occurred. This message led to feeling intensely intimidated ‚Äî as if my home was about to be invaded and I would be forced to sign legal documents under duress.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Meet at the caf√© for this appointment. We can then discuss the location of any potential future appointments after the initial assessment."</p>
  <p>
    ‚Äî Rachael (Ruah Scheduling), following Sheila‚Äôs handover.  
    This clearly indicates that first appointments are ordinarily conducted in neutral public settings ‚Äî not via unrequested home visits.  
    The contrast highlights that Sheila‚Äôs insistence on an initial home attendance was abnormal and, in this context, deeply intimidating.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For weeks now, I have been left feeling unsafe in my own home.</p>

<p>Since that point, the following has occurred:</p>

<ul>
<li>Police have been called to my home to try to remove me.</li>
<li>An Alma St crisis team has been called to try to remove me from my home.</li>
<li>Multiple calls from Alma St trying to pressure me into hospital admission.</li>
<li>Numerous phone calls from housing connected to this case.</li>
<li>Unexpected knocks from 'official' looking individuals at my door ‚Äî at unpredictable times ‚Äî causing acute distress.</li>
</ul>

<p>I no longer feel safe to leave my home ‚Äî or even to answer my door.</p>

<p>I do not know who is contacting these parties ‚Äî but it is not me.</p>

<p>My home is my only safe space ‚Äî and I am now being left to feel that it is under threat of invasion and coercion.</p>

<p>This is an unacceptable escalation ‚Äî and is compounding the direct harm already being caused.</p>

<!-- Born Wrong in Their World Section -->
<h4 style=" text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">
  Preview: Born Wrong In Their World (Memoir Excerpt)
</h4>

<p>I was born in the ‚Äô80s.</p>

<p>It was a different world back then. No internet. No awareness. People didn‚Äôt speak of things they didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äî they hid them. Buried them. Erased them with shame.</p>

<p>I must‚Äôve been around three. I don‚Äôt have clear memories from then ‚Äî which tells me I was still very young.<br>
But I remember fear. That part never left.<br>
Not fear of anything in particular ‚Äî just an ambient, silent dread.</p>

<p>There are photos of me smiling.<br>
So I know, logically, that I must‚Äôve laughed. Played. Been held.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Preschool: Echoes of a Beginning</h3>

<p>I have faint memories of preschool.<br>
Faint ‚Äî but persistent.<br>
Fragments, like old film reels burned at the edges.</p>

<p>There was a girl.<br>
Sarah? Sara? Something like that.<br>
Smaller than me. Long, straight light-brown hair.<br>
I don‚Äôt remember her face ‚Äî just a blur framed by hair and movement.</p>

<p>What I do remember is the feeling.<br>
Uncomfortable, unfamiliar ‚Äî but not bad.<br>
Something like belonging, though I didn‚Äôt understand it then.</p>

<p>Every time we walked through the preschool gates, she‚Äôd appear ‚Äî out of nowhere.<br>
Run up, jump, stretch, kiss me on the cheek, and vanish again.<br>
Routine. Predictable. Like clockwork.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt a one-off.<br>
Mum mentioned it once, offhand, like it amused her.<br>
So it must‚Äôve happened often enough to etch itself into her memory too.</p>

<p>But to me?<br>
It‚Äôs just Sarah ‚Äî or Sara ‚Äî a soft glitch in the beginning of a system that never made sense.<br>
Not a love story. Not even a friendship.<br>
Just a ghost loop from a time I didn‚Äôt understand myself yet.</p>

<p>Autism flattens some things like that.<br>
She‚Äôs not a person in my head ‚Äî she‚Äôs a pattern.<br>
And like most things from back then, she fades before I can ask her name.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are other fragments from preschool ‚Äî some confirmed by Mum, some lost to the fog.<br>
One sticks hard.</p>

<p>It was early on.<br>
Recess? Lunch? Whatever they called it.<br>
All the kids would run out to play ‚Äî to the sandpits, the swings, the chaos of childhood freedom.</p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p>I froze.<br>
Right where Mum left me.<br>
Inside.</p>

<p>Not out of defiance. Not out of confusion.<br>
But because my body wouldn‚Äôt move.<br>
Not couldn‚Äôt. Wouldn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>My mind screamed: <em>Move.</em><br>
My body replied: <em>Nope.</em><br>
Mind: <em>MOVE!</em><br>
Body: <em>hehehehe‚Ä¶ watch this.</em></p>

<p>And then I pissed myself.<br>
Not because I wasn‚Äôt toilet trained. I was.<br>
But because the shutdown was total.</p>

<p>Tears. Heat. The teacher‚Äôs voice ‚Äî too loud, too close.<br>
Dragged out in front of everyone. A scene. A freak.</p>

<p>It didn‚Äôt happen just once.<br>
It happened enough times that someone eventually caught on:<br>
If a shadow walked with me, I could move.<br>
I just needed to feel safe.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you know how to use the toilet, Kevin?‚Äù<br>
Nod.<br>
‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù<br>
Nod.<br>
‚ÄúKevin?‚Äù<br>
Face screws up. Meltdown begins.</p>

<p>Because repeating myself isn‚Äôt easy.<br>
Because being asked the same question over and over triggers panic ‚Äî not understanding.<br>
Because autism doesn‚Äôt always mean ‚Äúdifferent.‚Äù<br>
Sometimes it means <em>done explaining.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Where that memory fades, I don‚Äôt know.<br>
Time has never been linear for me.</p>

<p>It loops.<br>
It collapses in on itself.<br>
My brain doesn‚Äôt sort life by date ‚Äî it sorts it by pattern.</p>

<p>And sometimes‚Ä¶<br>
I see things before they happen.<br>
Not magic. Not prophecy.<br>
Just pattern recognition at a level most people never trained for.</p>

<p>But that‚Äôs a story for later ‚Äî deeper in the saga.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.</p>

<hr>

<p>But I don‚Äôt remember it.<br>
And that absence has haunted me more than any violent memory ever could.</p>

<p>Did that part of me die?<br>
Or is it still there ‚Äî buried beneath years of noise and survival?</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt socialise. I didn‚Äôt speak the ‚Äúright‚Äù way.<br>
I didn‚Äôt fit.</p>

<p>So they took me to a doctor.<br>
Who? When? I don‚Äôt know.<br>
They never told me.<br>
They never tell kids like me.</p>

<p>Even now, the records are lost. Or hidden. Or locked away somewhere.<br>
And somehow, it‚Äôs always my fault.</p>

<p>The word came back: Asperger‚Äôs.<br>
But instead of answers, it brought denial.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo. Our child is not retarded.‚Äù</p>

<p>That was the end of it.<br>
The diagnosis vanished.<br>
No support. No accommodation. No acknowledgement.<br>
It would not be spoken of again ‚Äî not until decades later, when a dying woman muttered truths between her regrets.</p>

<p>She lost every child she ever bore.<br>
And yet, I stayed.</p>

<p>Why?<br>
Because no one deserves to die alone. Not even her.<br>
I didn‚Äôt stay out of guilt.<br>
I stayed because it was right.<br>
And doing what‚Äôs right is how I live with myself.</p>

<hr>

<p>‚ÄúMy son will not be a retard.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be a pussy boy.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúMen don‚Äôt cry.‚Äù<br>
‚ÄúI‚Äôll beat the man into you.‚Äù</p>

<p>That was my father.<br>
A man who clung to the memory of a short stint in the army reserves like it made him something.</p>

<p>Our house was a training ground.<br>
Discipline. Routine. Domination.</p>

<p>I was a child.<br>
He treated me like a soldier.</p>

<p>And I didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt keep up.<br>
Why I kept breaking the rules I didn‚Äôt know existed.<br>
Why everything I did ‚Äî how I moved, felt, flinched, froze ‚Äî was wrong.</p>

<p>I wasn‚Äôt broken.<br>
The world was.<br>
And I was being punished for not conforming to a world that refused to make space for difference.</p>

<hr>

<p>I‚Äôve never asked to be treated differently.<br>
I‚Äôve only ever asked for the world to change ‚Äî<br>
because <em>we are different.</em></p>

<p>And that difference matters.</p>
