  <h2>Elsie Blay</h2>
  <p><strong>Elsie Blay — self-described advocate for the vulnerable.</strong><br>
  Alleged mother. Registered nurse. Public health expert.<br>
  Champion of homelessness services. Disability sector leader.<br>
  Executive Manager of Services, Ruah Community Services — since circa 2017.<br>
  Responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations across all Ruah programs: mental health, family and domestic violence, homelessness, disability.</p>

  <p>In her own public words, a voice for women, children, the homeless, and the disabled.<br>
  A defender of those left behind.<br>
  A builder of safe spaces — where no one would be isolated, starving, or left in fear.</p>

  <p><strong>That is the role she claimed. The mission she led. The system she managed.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>What follows is the truth of what happened under her watch.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>And why her silence — and her organisation’s failure — erased an autistic father from his children’s lives, left a man starving alone for years, and directly violated every value she publicly espoused.</strong></p>

  <p>This is not an opinion.<br>
  It is documented fact.<br>
  It is a matter of public record.</p>

  <p><strong>And it begins here.</strong></p>

  <h2>Debra Zanella</h2>
  <p><strong>Debra Zanella — public servant, advocate, architect of care.</strong><br>
  Chief Executive Officer of Ruah Community Services.<br>
  Chair of the Australian Alliance to End Homelessness.<br>
  Co-Chair of Reconciliation WA.<br>
  Former President of the Western Australian Council of Social Services.<br>
  Advisor to the Ministerial Housing First Homelessness Advisory Group.<br>
  Board member of the State Training Board.<br>
  Leader of the 50 Lives 50 Homes campaign.<br>
  Voice for women, children, and survivors of violence.<br>
  Builder of trauma-informed spaces.<br>
  Strategist of systemic change.</p>

  <p>Her public statements are clear: violence must be addressed at its roots.<br>
  Homelessness must be ended, not managed.<br>
  Systems must be accountable.</p>

  <p>She has spoken of the need for long-term healing, early intervention, and culturally safe care.<br>
  She has called for urgent action to protect women and children.</p>

  <p><strong>She has built a reputation on these principles.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>What follows is the documented reality of what occurred under her leadership.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The silence.<br>
  The neglect.<br>
  The erasure.</strong></p>

  <p>This is not conjecture.<br>
  It is evidence.<br>
  It is testimony.<br>
  It is the truth behind the image.</p>

  <h2>Graham Donnelly</h2>
  <p><strong>Graham Donnelly — chartered accountant.</strong><br>
  Chief Financial Officer of Ruah Community Services since 2016.<br>
  Former finance manager at Glasnevin Trust.<br>
  Former senior accountant at Activ Foundation.<br>
  Member of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand.<br>
  Fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.<br>
  Holder of a BA in Accounting and Finance from Liverpool John Moores University.</p>

  <p>He oversees the financial integrity of an organization dedicated to supporting the most vulnerable.<br>
  He ensures compliance, allocates resources, and upholds the fiscal responsibility that underpins every service Ruah provides.</p>

  <p>His role is not merely numbers on a ledger. It is the backbone of programs that claim to offer safety, dignity, and hope.</p>

  <p><strong>What follows is an examination of how financial decisions, under his stewardship, have impacted real lives.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The funding choices.<br>
  The resource allocations.<br>
  The priorities set.</strong></p>

  <p>This is not an abstract analysis.<br>
  It is a direct look at the consequences of financial governance.</p>
