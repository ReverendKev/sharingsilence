  Preview: Born Wrong In Their World (Memoir Excerpt)
</h4>

<p>I was born in the ’80s.</p>

<p>It was a different world back then. No internet. No awareness. People didn’t speak of things they didn’t understand — they hid them. Buried them. Erased them with shame.</p>

<p>I must’ve been around three. I don’t have clear memories from then — which tells me I was still very young.<br>
But I remember fear. That part never left.<br>
Not fear of anything in particular — just an ambient, silent dread.</p>

<p>There are photos of me smiling.<br>
So I know, logically, that I must’ve laughed. Played. Been held.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Preschool: Echoes of a Beginning</h3>

<p>I have faint memories of preschool.<br>
Faint — but persistent.<br>
Fragments, like old film reels burned at the edges.</p>

<p>There was a girl.<br>
Sarah? Sara? Something like that.<br>
Smaller than me. Long, straight light-brown hair.<br>
I don’t remember her face — just a blur framed by hair and movement.</p>

<p>What I do remember is the feeling.<br>
Uncomfortable, unfamiliar — but not bad.<br>
Something like belonging, though I didn’t understand it then.</p>

<p>Every time we walked through the preschool gates, she’d appear — out of nowhere.<br>
Run up, jump, stretch, kiss me on the cheek, and vanish again.<br>
Routine. Predictable. Like clockwork.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a one-off.<br>
Mum mentioned it once, offhand, like it amused her.<br>
So it must’ve happened often enough to etch itself into her memory too.</p>

<p>But to me?<br>
It’s just Sarah — or Sara — a soft glitch in the beginning of a system that never made sense.<br>
Not a love story. Not even a friendship.<br>
Just a ghost loop from a time I didn’t understand myself yet.</p>

<p>Autism flattens some things like that.<br>
She’s not a person in my head — she’s a pattern.<br>
And like most things from back then, she fades before I can ask her name.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are other fragments from preschool — some confirmed by Mum, some lost to the fog.<br>
One sticks hard.</p>

<p>It was early on.<br>
Recess? Lunch? Whatever they called it.<br>
All the kids would run out to play — to the sandpits, the swings, the chaos of childhood freedom.</p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p>I froze.<br>
Right where Mum left me.<br>
Inside.</p>

<p>Not out of defiance. Not out of confusion.<br>
But because my body wouldn’t move.<br>
Not couldn’t. Wouldn’t.</p>

<p>My mind screamed: <em>Move.</em><br>
My body replied: <em>Nope.</em><br>
Mind: <em>MOVE!</em><br>
Body: <em>hehehehe… watch this.</em></p>

<p>And then I pissed myself.<br>
Not because I wasn’t toilet trained. I was.<br>
But because the shutdown was total.</p>

<p>Tears. Heat. The teacher’s voice — too loud, too close.<br>
Dragged out in front of everyone. A scene. A freak.</p>

<p>It didn’t happen just once.<br>
It happened enough times that someone eventually caught on:<br>
If a shadow walked with me, I could move.<br>
I just needed to feel safe.</p>

<p>“Do you know how to use the toilet, Kevin?”<br>
Nod.<br>
“Are you sure?”<br>
Nod.<br>
“Kevin?”<br>
Face screws up. Meltdown begins.</p>

<p>Because repeating myself isn’t easy.<br>
Because being asked the same question over and over triggers panic — not understanding.<br>
Because autism doesn’t always mean “different.”<br>
Sometimes it means <em>done explaining.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Where that memory fades, I don’t know.<br>
Time has never been linear for me.</p>

<p>It loops.<br>
It collapses in on itself.<br>
My brain doesn’t sort life by date — it sorts it by pattern.</p>

<p>And sometimes…<br>
I see things before they happen.<br>
Not magic. Not prophecy.<br>
Just pattern recognition at a level most people never trained for.</p>

<p>But that’s a story for later — deeper in the saga.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.</p>

<hr>

<p>But I don’t remember it.<br>
And that absence has haunted me more than any violent memory ever could.</p>

<p>Did that part of me die?<br>
Or is it still there — buried beneath years of noise and survival?</p>

<p>I didn’t socialise. I didn’t speak the “right” way.<br>
I didn’t fit.</p>

<p>So they took me to a doctor.<br>
Who? When? I don’t know.<br>
They never told me.<br>
They never tell kids like me.</p>

<p>Even now, the records are lost. Or hidden. Or locked away somewhere.<br>
And somehow, it’s always my fault.</p>

<p>The word came back: Asperger’s.<br>
But instead of answers, it brought denial.</p>

<p>“No. Our child is not retarded.”</p>

<p>That was the end of it.<br>
The diagnosis vanished.<br>
No support. No accommodation. No acknowledgement.<br>
It would not be spoken of again — not until decades later, when a dying woman muttered truths between her regrets.</p>

<p>She lost every child she ever bore.<br>
And yet, I stayed.</p>

<p>Why?<br>
Because no one deserves to die alone. Not even her.<br>
I didn’t stay out of guilt.<br>
I stayed because it was right.<br>
And doing what’s right is how I live with myself.</p>

<hr>

<p>“My son will not be a retard.”<br>
“Don’t be a pussy boy.”<br>
“Men don’t cry.”<br>
“I’ll beat the man into you.”</p>

<p>That was my father.<br>
A man who clung to the memory of a short stint in the army reserves like it made him something.</p>

<p>Our house was a training ground.<br>
Discipline. Routine. Domination.</p>

<p>I was a child.<br>
He treated me like a soldier.</p>

<p>And I didn’t understand why I couldn’t keep up.<br>
Why I kept breaking the rules I didn’t know existed.<br>
Why everything I did — how I moved, felt, flinched, froze — was wrong.</p>

<p>I wasn’t broken.<br>
The world was.<br>
And I was being punished for not conforming to a world that refused to make space for difference.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’ve never asked to be treated differently.<br>
I’ve only ever asked for the world to change —<br>
because <em>we are different.</em></p>

<p>And that difference matters.</p>
