<blockquote><p>Wash yourselves. Make yourselves clean. Remove the evil from before my eyes. Stop doing wrong. Learn to do right. Seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless. Plead the case of the widow. If you are willing and obey, you shall eat the good of the land. But if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured. The mouth of the Lord has spoken it.</p>
<p>Carry each other’s burdens, and in doing so, fulfill the law of Christ. If anyone thinks they are something when they are nothing, they deceive themselves. Let each test their own work. Do not grow weary in doing good. At the proper time, we will reap a harvest — if we do not give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people — especially to those who are vulnerable, isolated, or broken.</p></blockquote>


<h2>Early May 2025</h2>
<p>I sent in a ‘contact us’ form from THEIR website, identifying myself and asking about my lost support worker.</p>
<p>S.J; first contact after 8 years. Trauma-informed care was not present, a request for a different staff member was made and ignored. During which I requested multiple times to escalate my complaint internally — she refused or ignored all.</p>
<p>I was made to feel unsafe and trauma responses occurred. Red flag should have been raised.</p>
<p>Administrative issues recorded on the police file and workers spoken too.</p>
<h2>Early - Mid May 2025</h2>
<p>Sent off to scheduling, admin mistakes with dates immediately. Meeting eventually scheduled with N.A and J.H. Staff residing under S.J’s position, so not escalated.</p>
<p>Administrative issues recorded on the police file and workers spoken too.</p>
<h2>Mid May 2025</h2>
<p>In person sit-down with N.A and J.H in a public setting. J.H identified N.A as her boss, N.A identified herself as a worker for the S.G program (confirming my request for internal escalation was ignored). I presented a full written statement of everything and a request for answers.</p>
<p>I received very little answers beyond; J.H admitted the failing where my case was “open but not active, sorry it was never closed off” and citing something about a “phone call” being how it ended allegedly.</p>
<p>N.A expressed her sorrow for what had happened and that my document was well written. I was requested to do a S.G referral. I was instructed I could find this on their website.</p>
<p>Some general conversation continued around the whole subject were J.H was leading a conversation that led me to feel coerced into saying something untruth, that at the time due to my social abilities I did not realise at the time.</p>
<h2>20 May 2025</h2>
<p>Contacted my GP to get the referral filled out. Explained depression, anxiety, trauma, spinal pain, fibromyalgia, and autism-related needs. I then emailed it off to THEM.</p>
<h2>Late May 2025</h2>
<p>Scheduling made contact, second meeting scheduled in public setting again as per express by scheduling staff was procedure and later alternative meeting places can be discussed.</p>
<p>I then express some issues and concerns about the last meeting that should have raised red flags.</p>
<p>N.A replied, what I perceived as; hostile.</p>
<p>Trauma-informed care was not present, lack of welfare checks or slow reaction to finally respond.</p>
<p>Administrative issues recorded on the police file and workers spoken too.</p>
<h2>28 May 2025</h2>
<p>Formal legal + FOI letter issued to THEM. Request included safeguarding, staff bans, compliance documentation, and suicide risk failures.</p>
<h2>30 May 2025</h2>
<p>E.B replies, asks for more time. Acknowledges complaint forwarded to Governance team.</p>
<h2>6 June 2025</h2>
<p>D. Z (CEO) replies, also requesting more time. No action on FOI or safeguarding confirmed yet.</p>
<h2>11 June 2025</h2>
<p>S. M (external legal) sends soft cease and desist re: videos/social content. Possibly internal panic triggered.</p>
<p>C&D; requested to stop “direct” contact with “staff/execs”.</p>
<p><small>(from here all correspondence was sent to S.M directly, with others INDIRECTLY CC’d, Bcc’d, or escalated to ceo, board and ambassadors. Other indirect means such as social media platforms, public facing emails and phone numbers were used, no illegal contact was made, everything was legally obtained and all traces were not hidden. No criminal activities were committed on my behalf.)</small></p>
<h2>13 June 2025</h2>
<p>I received a final reply from S.M. “won’t reply further”</p>
<h2>Mid June 2025</h2>
<p>I begin direct and indirect contact to senior execs, board members and ambassadors via public and social channels.</p>
<p>Calmly tried to resolve and find a resolution suitable for all.</p>
<p>Made no threats, did nothing illegal and was not irrational.</p>
<p>Multiple attempts to resolve on my part have been made through the whole process.</p>
<h2>2 July 2025</h2>
<p>I am arrested and charged with 6 counts of using a carrier service to menace and harass.</p>
<p>All electronics seized until court on 31st, negotiated my phone return for mental health.</p>
<p>The phone got broken in the process (7 days to recover bank and essentials).</p>
<p>Yet I had to block the CEO, most never blocked my number, or email?</p>
<p>Date spans 30th June to 2nd July, First report filed 2nd June (days after I sent legal and FOI)?</p>
<p>Felt menaced and harassed yet emailed back to request more time on the 6th?</p>
<p>Lawyer emailed 11th but did not mention staff feeling menaced and harassed?</p>
<p>And again on 13th and still no mention?</p>
<p>No request to stop between 13th and 2nd from anyone, not even the board I was calling?</p>
<p>Date and times lost at this stage due to loss of electronics.</p>
<h2>Early July 2025</h2>
<p>Earlier Pristiq dose was raised to 150mg → triggered manic episodes. Had been days without sleep.</p>
<p>Attend FSH around 3-5am due to crisis. Waited hours and then redirected to Alma at 5am being advised they open at 7am.</p>
<p>Arrived at Alma st, early and rested and paced around out the front until staff moved me ‘out of the cold'. Delirious.</p>
<p>Collapsed at Alma Street reception. After pacing a while.</p>
<p>A female doctor denies manic state. Says 'the pills didn’t make you manic'.</p>
<p>Explained you were suicidal. I was warned I'd be hospitalized if I said that. So, I lied and said I was fine. I was allowed to leave.</p>
<p>I had finally let the Pristiq wear out my system a bit and fell asleep. I had in delirium updated the website with suicidal ideology prior to sleeping.</p>
<p>The police entered my home while asleep. Welfare check and taken to Hospital.</p>
<p>Discharged with “insomnia” as the diagnosis and released to return home to sleep.</p>
<h2>8 July 2025</h2>
<p>Return to normality. Medication dose returned to normal, sleep normalized, new electronics obtained. Life is still unstable, not good and the fight goes on but the stability I knew has returned. </p>
<p>Lots of evidence has come through and needs to be documented and sorted.</p>
<p><strong>To Be Continued.</strong></p>
