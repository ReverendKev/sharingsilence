    <h1>#SHARINGSILENCE - THE MEMOIR</h1>
    <h3>where it all begain...</h3>

    <p>This is where everything began, before Ruah, before this site and what I had originally intended the site to be.</p>
    <h2>Just the story of my life<h2>
    <p><strong>where the silence first began...</strong></p>
    <p><small>and continued...</small></p>

<!-- BORN WRONG -->

<blockquote>
<h2>Born Wrong in Their World</h2>
<p>I was born in the ’80s.</p>
<p>It was a different world back then. No internet. No awareness. People didn’t speak of things they didn’t understand — they hid them. Buried them. Erased them with shame.</p>
<p>I must’ve been around three. I don’t have clear memories from then — which tells me I was still very young. But I remember fear. That part never left. Not fear of anything in particular — just an ambient, silent dread.</p>
<p>There are photos of me smiling. So I know, logically, that I must’ve laughed. Played. Been held.</p>
<h3>Preschool: Echoes of a Beginning</h3>
<p>I have faint memories of preschool. Fragments, like old film reels burned at the edges.</p>
<p>There was a girl. Sarah? Sara? Something like that. Smaller than me. Long, straight light-brown hair. I don’t remember her face — just a blur framed by hair and movement.</p>
<p>What I do remember is the feeling. Uncomfortable, unfamiliar — but not bad. Something like belonging, though I didn’t understand it then.</p>
<p>Every time we walked through the preschool gates, she’d appear. Run up, jump, stretch, kiss me on the cheek, and vanish again. Routine. Predictable. Like clockwork.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a one-off. Mum mentioned it once, offhand, like it amused her. So it must’ve happened often enough to etch itself into her memory too.</p>
<p>To me, she’s not a person — she’s a pattern. And like most things from back then, she fades before I can ask her name.</p>
<p>Autism flattens some things like that.</p>
<h3>Shutdown Memory</h3>
<p>One sticks hard. Recess, maybe. The others would run out to sandpits and swings. I stood still. Not from confusion — my body wouldn’t move.</p>
<p>My mind screamed: <em>Move.</em><br>
My body replied: <em>Nope.</em><br>
Mind: <em>MOVE!</em><br>
Body: <em>hehehe… watch this.</em></p>
<p>And I pissed myself. Not because I wasn’t toilet trained. I was. But because the shutdown was total.</p>
<p>It happened more than once. Until someone realised: if a shadow walked with me, I could move. I just needed to feel safe.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to use the toilet, Kevin?”<br>
Nod.<br>
“Are you sure?”<br>
Nod.<br>
“Kevin?”<br>
Face screws up. Meltdown begins.</p>
<p>Because repeating myself isn’t easy.<br>
Because being asked the same question over and over triggers panic — not understanding.<br>
Because autism doesn’t always mean “different.”<br>
Sometimes it means <em>done explaining.</em></p>
<h3>Asperger’s, and Erasure</h3>
<p>The word came back: Asperger’s.<br>
But instead of answers, it brought denial.</p>
<p>“No. Our child is not retarded.”</p>
<p>That was the end of it. The diagnosis vanished. No support. No accommodation. No acknowledgement. It would not be spoken of again — not until decades later, when a dying woman muttered truths between her regrets.</p>
<h3>The Father</h3>
<p>“My son will not be a retard.”<br>
“Don’t be a pussy boy.”<br>
“Men don’t cry.”<br>
“I’ll beat the man into you.”</p>
<p>That was my father. A man who clung to the memory of a short stint in the army reserves like it made him something. Our house was a training ground. Discipline. Routine. Domination. I was a child. He treated me like a soldier.</p>
<p>I wasn’t broken.<br>
The world was.<br>
And I was being punished for not conforming to a world that refused to make space for difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>"I’ve never asked to be treated differently.</p>
<p>I’ve only ever asked for the world to change — because we are different."</em></p>
<p><small>– Me</small></p>

<!-- BEHIND THE CHAIR -->

<blockquote>
<h2>Behind the Chair</h2>
<p><strong>The memories are scattered — some vague, others sharp in feeling but blurred in detail.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They were likely buried, either by trauma or by survival instinct. I don’t know.</strong></p?
<p>But I know the pain. And I know the confusion.</p>
<p>My sister was three years older than me.<br>She was also harmed — I believe by our father. Whether she was told to act the way she did, or whether it was trauma acting through her, I can’t know.<br>She cut contact with the family years ago, blamed <em>me</em>, and vanished. I never understood why. Still don’t.</p>
<p>One of my earliest memories is of an armchair in her bedroom.<br>I was hiding behind it — not from danger exactly, just… hiding.<br>She was there too. And she told me to do things.<br>I didn’t understand them. I was three. She was six.<br>I didn’t know what “right” or “wrong” was. Just that something felt off.</p>
<p>I remember another setting — under the blankets.<br>Things happened there too. Things that happened more than once.<br>She gave me instructions I didn’t understand — not then, not fully even now.<br>She used words I didn’t know, told me to act out things I didn’t yet have a body for.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long it went on.<br>I don’t know how often.<br>But I remember the pattern.<br>That’s how my brain holds things — not in sequence, but in repetition.</p>
<p>This is what my earliest years looked like.<br>Not joy. Not laughter. Just confusion, pressure, obedience, and a sense of something being deeply wrong.</p>
<p>I don’t have good memories until maybe age 10 or 11 — and even those are tangled in later pain.<br>But they exist, small as they are.<br>And I hold onto those few flecks of light — because on the dark days, they’re all I’ve got.</p>

<!-- THE LURGY -->

<blockquote>
<h2>The Lurgy</h2>
<p><strong>Somewhere near Whiteman Park. Childhood. Year unknown.</strong></p>
<p>We weren’t allowed in the caves.</p>
 <p>They cost money.</p>
 <p>That part I remember clearly.</p>
<p>I don’t know how old I was — maybe six? Maybe eight? Still small enough to notice every stick on the ground. Still curious about every patch of bushland. We’d driven out to Whiteman Park as a family — Mum, Dad, me, L, and C — though I couldn’t tell you why or when.</p>
<p>We weren’t at the cave itself. We stayed in the free part — the bush tracks, the playground, whatever didn’t cost anything. That’s how it always was. If it had an entry fee, we didn’t go.</p>
<p>We were walking near the trees when L stepped into a patch of mud. It looked solid — just leaves and dry dirt — but her leg went straight down. One side of her body dropped into the mud, up to the knee. It clung to her sock. It was thick. Messy. Proper mud.</p>
<p>We didn’t help her.</p>
<p>We laughed.</p>
<p>We ran.</p>
<p><em>“You’ve got the lurgy!”</em> we shouted.</p>
<p>That word — <em>lurgy</em> — it meant everything and nothing. Mum used it for colds, for stomach bugs, for sneezes, even for gross food smells. If something made her scrunch her nose, it was the lurgy. If you were sick, unlucky, or just disgusting that day — you had the lurgy.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a real word. Not one we learned in school. But we used it like it was. We knew exactly what it meant. You got the lurgy, people stayed away. That was the rule.</p>
<p>That day, L had it. And that was enough.</p>
<p>It wasn’t cruel — not in our heads. It was a game. That’s how we made sense of things. No money? We made up games. Couldn’t go in the caves? Didn’t matter — we had the lurgy now. That was the adventure. Running through the bush yelling, dodging an imaginary disease we’d made up.</p>
<p>We never thought about how L felt.</p>
<p>She was the one left behind, wet and cold, trying to get her leg unstuck.</p>
<p>But we were laughing.</p>
<p>And laughing meant things were okay.</p>
<p>It meant no one could tell how poor we were.</p>
<p>It meant we didn’t care about the caves.</p>
<p>It meant we had our own stories.</p>
<p>Our own language.</p>
<p>Our own way of surviving.</p>
<p>We couldn’t afford a lot of things.</p>
<p>But the lurgy? That was free.</p>
<p>And sometimes, that was enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- WORMS -->

<blockquote>
<h2>Worms</h2>
<p><em>a diagnosis by Mum</em></p>
<p>In our house, if you scratched your bum — you had worms.</p>
<p>Didn’t matter why. Didn't matter if it was once or ten times, over jeans or under. A single subconscious itch and you were officially wormed. Diagnosis instant. Treatment inevitable.</p>
<p>Mum was obsessed. Not in a paranoid way exactly — more like it was a known fact of life, the way weather existed. Worms were real. Worms were everywhere. And children, apparently, were their natural hosts.</p>
<p>We were wormed regularly. Like clockwork. Not because we had symptoms — but because Mum was sure we would soon. Or already did. Or maybe had last week and forgot to tell her. Maybe one of us brought them home from school. Maybe the dog passed them on. Maybe it was just Tuesday.</p>
<p>You got hungry between meals? Worms.</p>
<p>You ate too fast? Worms.</p>
<p>You looked pale? Worms.</p>
<p>Tired? Fidgety? Daydreaming? Worms.</p>
<p>We joked about it as kids — behind her back, of course. <em>“Ohhh you’re hungry? Must be the worms.”</em> It became our own kind of diagnosis — a household punchline we used to tease each other, a shorthand for anything Mum might jump on.</p>
<p>But under the laughter, there was this constant ritual of tablets and suspicion. Line up. Swallow this. No questions. Just do it. Mum said so.</p>
<p>And I don’t know if any of us ever had worms. Maybe once? Maybe never. But in that house, it was always safer to assume you did.</p>
<p>Worms weren’t a condition. They were a certainty.</p>
