<h1>Sharing Silence; #RuahRuinsLives</h1>
    
  <p>I don’t know who’s reading this.<br>
  Maybe you’ve never met me. Maybe you’re staff, admin, management — or just someone who happened to be CC’d.<br>
  You didn’t ask for this. But now you have it.<br>
  And I need you to hear me.</p>

  <p><b>I am autistic.</b><br>
  I have an IQ of 140. My mind is sharp — but when I’m overwhelmed, I go non-verbal.<br>
  My speech shuts down. My responses collapse.<br>
  People think I don’t understand.<br>
  But I do.<br>
  I just can’t get the words out when I need them most.<br>
  And I remember everything.</p>

  <p><b>Ten years ago</b>, Ruah assigned me a support worker. Her name was Mary.<br>
  She helped stabilise my life. I started therapy. I got my children back.<br>
  Supervised visits became overnights.<br>
  My world was slowly coming back together.</p>

  <p><b>Then, eight years ago, Mary left.</b><br>
  No warning. No transition. No follow-up.<br>
  I was just alone again.<br>
  And everything — absolutely everything — began to fall apart.</p>

  <p>NDIS changed. My funding stayed, but my supports vanished.<br>
  A provider came into my home. They touched my things. They left.<br>
  The money disappeared.<br>
  I reported it. Nothing changed.</p>

  <p>The next provider came.<br>
  They never returned. I still don’t know why.</p>

  <p>The calls that followed were cold, impersonal, and overwhelming.<br>
  There was no care, just pressure.<br>
  I didn’t know who these people were. I still don’t.</p>

  <p>My GP left. I relapsed on opioids. Then on alcohol.<br>
  My mother became terminally ill. I became her carer. Then she died.<br>
  And if anyone from Ruah tried to reach me during that time — I don’t remember.<br>
  If they did, it didn’t help. It didn’t hold.<br>
  Because what I needed was someone who wouldn’t vanish when I couldn't speak.<br>
  Someone who knew what crisis actually looks like.</p>

  <p><b>And in that darkness — I lost my children again.</b></p>

  <p>Not by court. Not by choice.<br>
  Ten years ago, we had a court-ordered agreement. I followed every step.<br>
  And after years of work — they were back in my life.</p>

  <p>But then I lost my support.<br>
  And then my ex moved. Cut off contact.<br>
  And I didn’t have the strength, the knowledge, or the people behind me to fight it.</p>

  <p><b>I didn’t disappear.<br>
  I was erased.</b></p>

  <p>They now grow up thinking I walked away.<br>
  That I didn’t care.<br>
  That I gave up.</p>

  <p>But I didn’t.<br>
  I was alone.<br>
  And no one — not a single system that claimed to protect us — reached in to pull me back.</p>

  <p>I missed birthdays. I missed years.<br>
  And I will never get that time back.</p>

  <p><b>And neither will they.</b></p>

  <p>You say you protect the vulnerable.<br>
  But when I became one — again — you weren’t there.<br>
  You had the records. The notes. The red flags.<br>
  You knew the warning signs.<br>
  And nothing happened.</p>

  <p>I’m not writing this to shame you.<br>
  I’m writing it because I need you to understand what silence costs.</p>

  <p><b>Because if you’ve read this far — you’re holding it now too.</b></p>

  <p>And this letter didn’t land in one inbox.<br>
  It’s being read.<br>
  Right now. Quietly. In offices. In meetings. In between tasks.<br>
  Maybe someone’s already rereading it.<br>
  Maybe someone’s already asking questions.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what this letter will do.<br>
  Maybe nothing.<br>
  Maybe something.</p>

  <p>But whatever happens next — even if it’s silence again — will say something.<br>
  About all of us.</p>

  <p><b>I’m Kev.</b><br>
  I’ve carried this alone for too long, and I don’t know what’s left of me.</p>
